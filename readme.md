# Oracle Database Project

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a relational database using Oracle Database 19c or a later version. The database must include at least six independent entities in the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and at least one many-to-many relationship.

## Objectives
1. **Database Description**  
   - Briefly present the purpose and utility of the database.

2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
   - Design the ERD, defining entities, relationships, and attributes in Romanian.

3. **Conceptual Model Diagram**  
   - Convert the ERD into a conceptual model, including all necessary attributes, and describe it in Romanian.

4. **Database Implementation in Oracle**  
   - Define all tables and include integrity constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, etc.).

5. **Data Insertion**  
   - Insert meaningful data into the tables:
     - At least **5 records** for each independent entity.
     - At least **10 records** for each associative table.

6. **Stored Procedure with Collections**  
   - Formulate a problem that can be solved using a stored procedure that employs all three types of collections studied.
   - Call the procedure.

7. **Stored Procedure with Cursors**  
   - Define a problem that requires a stored procedure utilizing two different types of cursors, one being a parameterized cursor dependent on the other.
   - Call the procedure.

8. **Stored Function Using Multiple Tables**  
   - Formulate a problem requiring a stored function that references **three tables** in a single SQL command.
   - Handle exceptions, including `NO_DATA_FOUND` and `TOO_MANY_ROWS`.
   - Call the function to demonstrate all handled cases.

9. **Stored Procedure with Multiple Tables and Custom Exceptions**  
   - Define a stored procedure with at least **two parameters** that references **five tables** in a single SQL command.
   - Define and handle at least **two custom exceptions** in addition to predefined ones.
   - Call the procedure to showcase all defined cases.

10. **LMD Trigger at Command Level**  
    - Define and activate a **trigger at the command level**.

11. **LMD Trigger at Row Level**  
    - Define and activate a **trigger at the row level**.

12. **LDD Trigger**  
    - Define and activate an **LDD trigger**.

## Technologies Used
- Oracle Database 19c+
- SQL
- PL/SQL

## How to Run
1. Set up an Oracle 19c+ environment.
2. Execute the provided SQL scripts to create tables and constraints.
3. Insert sample data.
4. Execute the stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
